// A getter method returns the value of the propertyâ€™s value. A getter is also called an accessor.
// A setter method updated the property's value. A setter is also known as mutator. 
/// A getter method starts with the keyword "get" and a setter method begins with "set" method
// Class ke andar ek aisa method jo class ko change kar dein called getter
// Setter wo jo tumse value lein aur class ke andar change kar dein

// That's how we use getter and setter in js but in the case of typescript we uses the getter and setter with different method
