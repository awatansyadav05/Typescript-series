LECTURE 1
Typescript is a syntactic superset of javascript which adds static typing
This means that typescript adds syntax on top of javascript, allowing developers to add types.
TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
Typescript uses compile time type checking, it means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.


TypeScript Simple Types
primitives means without the {} [] () brackets
@boolean -- true or false values
@number -- whole numbers and floating point values
@string -- text values like "Typescript rocks"

There are two more 2 common primitives in later used in version of javascript and typescript
@bigint -- same as @number but allows larger values of negative and positive number
@symbol -- used to globally unique identifier.
